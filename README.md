# Machine Learning Project 1

**`Members`:** Julie Favre, Louis Duval, Mathieu Ferrey

## Requirements
1. `Numpy` is the only requirement for this project.

## How to use
1. Download the `train.csv` and `test.csv` from https://github.com/epfml/ML_course/blob/master/projects/project1/data/dataset.zip and put them in the dataset/ folder.
2. Run 
```shell
python run.py
```

## Files
### `notebook.ipynb`
The jupyter notebook we used to visualize and understand the data to process it and also to learn the best hyper parameters of our models and visualize them.

### `helpers.py`
Contains helper functions provided to us for loading data, predicting the labels and creating a csv submission, among many others

### `implementations.py`
Contains our six different model implementations
mean_squared_error_gd
mean_squared_error_sgd
least_squares
ridge_regression
logitic_regression
reg_logistic_regression

### `run.py`
Script that generates the exact output the we submitted for the competition.
